# SQL Case Studies

## About

This repository contains the solutions to various analytics case studies that I find on the internet. I have solved the case studies using SQL Server but you can use any RDBMS of your choice. 

## Structure of the Case Studies
- Each case study contains an `Insert.sql` file. Use the file to insert data locally in your system. 
- To obtain the analysis done, each case study contains an `Analysis.sql` file. Open the file to get started. 

## Concepts Covered in Analysis
- Where filters and Ordering data
- Group by Aggregates
- String Transformations
- Regular Expressions
- Datetime Manipulation
- Complex Table Joins
- Case When Statements
- Window Functions
- Temp Tables and Views
- Common Table Expressions and Subqueries
- Complex Functions Formation
